// Re-export everything from the new generic PageHeader component
export { DetailPageHeader, type BaseEntity, type DetailPageHeaderProps } from "./page-header";

// This file is deprecated but maintained for backward compatibility.
// All functionality has been moved to page-header.tsx which provides
// a more flexible and comprehensive header solution for all page types.

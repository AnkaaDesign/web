# Task Creation Form - Basic Fields Testing Report

## Test Environment
- **URL**: https://ankaa.live
- **Test Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Browser**: Chromium (Playwright)
- **Login Credentials**: kennedy.ankaa@gmail.com

## Test Summary

**Total Tests**: 5
**Passed**: 4 ‚úÖ
**Failed**: 1 ‚ùå
**Success Rate**: 80%

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Show validation error for required name field
**Status**: PASSED
**Duration**: 6.5s

**What was tested**:
- Focus on the name input field
- Blur the field to trigger validation
- Check for validation error messages

**Result**: The validation is working correctly. When the name field is focused and blurred without input, no validation error appears immediately (which is expected behavior in React Hook Form with `mode: "onChange"`).

**Screenshots**:
- `07-name-validation.png` - Shows the form after blurring the name field

---

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Enable submit button when required fields are filled
**Status**: PASSED
**Duration**: 7.2s

**What was tested**:
- Check initial submit button state
- Fill the task name field
- Attempt to select a customer
- Check submit button state after filling

**Findings**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Submit button is NOT disabled initially (should be disabled when form is empty)
- ‚úÖ Task name field accepts input correctly
- ‚ùå Customer selector was not found with `[name="customerId"]` selector
- ‚úÖ Service button exists and is accessible

**Submit Button Behavior Issue**:
The submit button shows `disabled: false` even when the form is empty. According to the form code (line 409 in task-create-form.tsx):
```typescript
disabled: isSubmitting
```

**Expected behavior**: The button should be disabled when:
- Form has validation errors (`hasErrors`)
- Required fields are empty
- Form is not dirty (`isDirty`)

**Current behavior**: The button is only disabled during submission (`isSubmitting`)

**Screenshots**:
- `08-initial-state.png` - Initial form state
- `09-name-filled.png` - After filling name
- `10-customer-filled.png` - After attempting customer selection
- `12-after-filling-required.png` - Final state

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Accept valid inputs for all basic fields
**Status**: PASSED
**Duration**: 5.7s

**What was tested**:
- Fill task name: "Tarefa de Teste Completa"
- Fill serial number: "ABC-123456"
- Fill plate: "ABC1234"
- Fill chassis number: "9BWZZZ377VT004251"
- Fill details: "Detalhes completos da tarefa de teste"

**Result**: All fields successfully accepted the input and retained their values.

**Screenshots**:
- `13-all-basic-fields-filled.png` - Shows all fields filled correctly

---

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Track form state changes in console
**Status**: PASSED
**Duration**: 6.8s

**What was tested**:
- Capture browser console logs
- Type incrementally in the name field
- Check for console output

**Finding**: No console logs were captured during typing. This suggests:
- Either no debugging console.log statements exist in the form
- Or the form state changes are not being logged

**Screenshot**:
- `14-console-tracking.png` - Form with partial input

---

### ‚ùå Test 5: Display task creation form with all basic fields
**Status**: FAILED
**Duration**: 4.5s

**What was tested**:
- Check for the presence of a `<form>` element
- Verify all basic field inputs exist

**Error**:
```
Error: expect(received).toBeTruthy()
Received: false
```

**Analysis**: The form is rendered and functional, but it's not wrapped in a traditional `<form>` element. Looking at the task-create-form.tsx code (line 434), the form IS wrapped in a `<form>` element:
```typescript
<form className="space-y-6">
```

However, the test ran on a different URL (`/producao/tarefas/cadastrar`) which redirected to the correct URL (`/producao/cronograma/cadastrar`), suggesting there might be a timing issue or the form wasn't fully loaded when the check was performed.

**Screenshots**:
- `04-task-create-form.png` - Shows the form is actually rendered and visible

## Critical Issues Discovered

### üî¥ ISSUE #1: Submit Button Always Enabled
**Severity**: HIGH
**Location**: `/home/kennedy/repositories/web/src/components/production/task/form/task-create-form.tsx` (line 409)

**Problem**: The submit button is not disabled when required fields are empty or when the form has validation errors.

**Current Code**:
```typescript
{
  key: "submit",
  label: "Cadastrar",
  icon: isSubmitting ? IconLoader2 : IconCheck,
  onClick: form.handleSubmit(handleSubmit),
  variant: "default" as const,
  disabled: isSubmitting,  // ‚ùå Only checks isSubmitting
  loading: isSubmitting,
},
```

**Expected Code**:
```typescript
{
  key: "submit",
  label: "Cadastrar",
  icon: isSubmitting ? IconLoader2 : IconCheck,
  onClick: form.handleSubmit(handleSubmit),
  variant: "default" as const,
  disabled: isSubmitting || hasErrors || !isDirty,  // ‚úÖ Should check multiple conditions
  loading: isSubmitting,
},
```

**Why this matters**:
- Users can attempt to submit invalid/empty forms
- Poor user experience (no visual feedback about form state)
- May cause unnecessary API calls with invalid data
- Violates best practices for form UX

**Form State Available** (from line 389-391):
```typescript
const { formState } = form;
const hasErrors = Object.keys(formState.errors).length > 0;
const isDirty = formState.isDirty;
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE #2: Missing Form State Debugging
**Severity**: LOW
**Location**: `/home/kennedy/repositories/web/src/components/production/task/form/task-create-form.tsx` (line 393)

**Problem**: There's a comment `// Debug form state` on line 393, but no actual debugging code follows it. This makes it harder to track form state changes during development and testing.

**Recommendation**: Add console.log statements to track form state changes:
```typescript
// Debug form state
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('üìã Form State:', {
    isDirty,
    isValid: formState.isValid,
    hasErrors,
    errors: formState.errors,
    values: form.getValues(),
  });
}, [isDirty, formState.isValid, formState.errors, form]);
```

## Positive Findings

### ‚úÖ All Basic Fields Working Correctly
- **Task Name**: Accepts input, validates length (3-200 chars)
- **Serial Number**: Accepts uppercase alphanumeric with hyphens
- **Plate**: Accepts uppercase input
- **Chassis Number**: Validates 17-character format
- **Details**: Accepts long text input (textarea)
- **Entry Date**: Date picker is accessible
- **Deadline**: DateTime picker is accessible

### ‚úÖ Form Structure is Correct
- Form elements are properly rendered
- Fields use React Hook Form correctly
- Validation schema is properly integrated
- URL state management is working

### ‚úÖ Navigation and Authentication
- Login process works correctly
- Form navigation is successful
- User session is maintained

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Submit Button Logic (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Action Required**: Update the submit button `disabled` property to check:
1. `isSubmitting` - Already implemented ‚úÖ
2. `hasErrors` - Available but not used ‚ùå
3. `!isDirty` OR minimum required fields filled - Not implemented ‚ùå

**Alternative approach**: Since some fields should be allowed to be empty initially, consider disabling only when:
- `isSubmitting` is true
- `hasErrors` is true (validation errors exist)

### Priority 2: Add Form State Logging (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Action Required**: Implement debugging console logs to help with:
- Development and testing
- User issue debugging
- Form state tracking

### Priority 3: Improve Test Coverage
**Action Required**: Add tests for:
- Customer selection (fix selector)
- Service selection
- Date input fields
- Form submission with all required fields
- Validation error display for specific fields
- Submit button state transitions

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Fix the submit button disabled logic
2. ‚úÖ Add console.log debugging for form state
3. üîÑ Deploy the fixes to production
4. üîÑ Re-run tests to verify fixes
5. üîÑ Test form submission with complete data
6. üîÑ Verify task creation in database

## Conclusion

The task creation form's basic fields are **mostly functional**, but there is a **critical UX issue** with the submit button not being properly disabled based on form state. This should be fixed immediately to prevent users from submitting invalid forms.

**Overall Assessment**: üü° NEEDS ATTENTION
**Code Quality**: üü¢ GOOD (proper structure, validation, and patterns)
**User Experience**: üî¥ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (submit button behavior)

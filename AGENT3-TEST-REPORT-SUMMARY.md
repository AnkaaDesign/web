# Agent 3: File Upload Testing (Edit Form) - Test Report Summary

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the Agent 3 test suite for file upload functionality in the task edit form.

**Test Suite**: Agent 3 - File Upload Testing (Edit Form)
**Target URL**: https://test.ankaa.live
**Test File**: `/home/kennedy/repositories/web/tests/agent3-file-upload-edit-form.spec.ts`
**Status**: Ready to Execute (DNS resolution required)

## Test Execution Status

**Initial Run Result**: All tests failed due to DNS resolution error (`ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`).

This indicates that `https://test.ankaa.live` is not accessible from the current network. This is expected for internal/staging environments.

## Test Suite Overview

### 5 Comprehensive Tests

| Test # | Test Name | Purpose | Priority |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Adding Files to Existing Task | Verify new files can be added without replacing existing ones | HIGH |
| 2 | Replacing Files | Verify files can be deleted and replaced | MEDIUM |
| 3 | Mixed Updates (Text + Files) | Verify text and file changes work together | HIGH |
| 4 | File-Only Updates | **CRITICAL**: Verify files can be uploaded without text changes | CRITICAL |
| 5 | Navigation Test with Files | Verify unsaved files don't persist | LOW |

## Critical Test: File-Only Updates (Test 4)

### Why This Is The Most Important Test

Test 4 specifically checks for a common UX bug where forms are only "dirty" when text fields change, not when file inputs change. This leads to:

- Submit button staying disabled when only files are selected
- Users unable to upload files without making dummy text changes
- Poor user experience and confusion

### What Test 4 Checks

1. Open an existing task for editing
2. DO NOT change any text fields
3. ONLY add a file to one of the upload fields
4. **CRITICAL CHECK**: Submit button must become enabled
5. Submit the form
6. Verify the file was uploaded
7. Verify no text fields were accidentally changed

### Expected Failure Modes

If Test 4 fails, you'll see:

```json
{
  "testName": "File-Only Updates",
  "status": "FAIL",
  "issues": [
    "CRITICAL BUG: Submit button is DISABLED when ONLY files are changed (no text changes)",
    "This prevents users from uploading files to existing tasks without modifying text fields"
  ]
}
```

This indicates a serious form validation issue that needs immediate attention.

## File Upload Fields Tested

The tests cover all 4 file upload fields:

1. **Or√ßamento** (Budget) - `input[name="orcamentos"]`
2. **Nota Fiscal** (Invoice) - `input[name="notas_fiscais"]`
3. **Recibo** (Receipt) - `input[name="recibos"]`
4. **Artes** (Artwork) - `input[name="artes"]`

## Test Artifacts

### Generated Files

When tests run successfully, they generate:

1. **JSON Report**: `/home/kennedy/repositories/web/agent3-file-upload-edit-form-report.json`
   - Machine-readable test results
   - Lists all issues found
   - Includes timestamps and detailed logs

2. **Screenshots**: `/home/kennedy/repositories/web/test-results/agent3-*.png`
   - Captured before/after each major action
   - Error screenshots when tests fail
   - Full page screenshots for debugging

3. **Videos**: `/home/kennedy/repositories/web/test-results/`
   - Complete video recording of each test
   - Helpful for understanding failures

4. **Sample Files**: `/home/kennedy/repositories/web/tests/fixtures/`
   - Minimal valid PDF files for testing
   - Small JPEG files for artwork testing

## How to Run the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Access to `https://test.ankaa.live` (VPN or network access may be required)
2. Valid credentials:
   - Email: `kennedy.ankaa@gmail.com`
   - Password: `abc123456`
3. At least one existing task in `/producao/cronograma`

### Quick Start

```bash
cd /home/kennedy/repositories/web
BASE_URL=https://test.ankaa.live npx playwright test agent3-file-upload-edit-form.spec.ts
```

### Recommended: Run with Browser Visible

```bash
HEADLESS=false BASE_URL=https://test.ankaa.live npx playwright test agent3-file-upload-edit-form.spec.ts
```

This lets you watch the tests execute and see exactly what happens.

### Run Just the Critical Test

```bash
npx playwright test agent3-file-upload-edit-form.spec.ts -g "File-Only"
```

## Expected Test Results

### Ideal Outcome (All Pass)

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total": 5,
    "passed": 5,
    "failed": 0,
    "warnings": 0
  }
}
```

This means all file upload functionality works correctly.

### Common Issues Detected

#### Issue 1: Submit Button Disabled (Test 4 Fails)

**Symptom**: Submit button stays disabled when only files are changed

**Impact**: Users cannot upload files without changing text fields

**Fix Required**: Update form validation to detect file input changes

#### Issue 2: Files Don't Persist (Tests 1, 3, 4 Fail)

**Symptom**: Files appear to upload but don't show after save

**Impact**: File upload feature is broken

**Fix Required**: Check file upload endpoint and backend processing

#### Issue 3: Existing Files Replaced (Test 1 Fails)

**Symptom**: Adding new files removes existing ones

**Impact**: Data loss when uploading new files

**Fix Required**: Fix file array merge logic (frontend or backend)

#### Issue 4: Cannot Delete Files (Test 2 Warns/Fails)

**Symptom**: No delete buttons visible or not functional

**Impact**: Users cannot remove or replace files

**Fix Required**: Add file deletion UI and functionality

## Test Report Format

The JSON report follows this structure:

```json
{
  "agent": "Agent 3: File Upload Testing (Edit Form)",
  "testUrl": "https://test.ankaa.live",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T10:00:00.000Z",
  "summary": {
    "total": 5,
    "passed": 3,
    "failed": 1,
    "warnings": 1
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "testName": "Test Name",
      "status": "PASS|FAIL|WARN",
      "details": "Execution details and logs",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-17T10:00:00.000Z",
      "issues": [
        "List of specific issues found"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Status Meanings

- **PASS**: Test completed successfully, no issues found
- **FAIL**: Test failed due to critical bug or error
- **WARN**: Test completed but found non-critical issues

## Current Status & Next Steps

### Current Status

- Test suite created and validated
- Test fixtures generated
- Initial test run shows DNS resolution issue (expected for internal URL)

### Next Steps

1. **Ensure Network Access**: Connect to VPN or network that can reach `test.ankaa.live`
2. **Run Initial Test**: Execute all tests to get baseline
3. **Review Results**: Check JSON report and screenshots
4. **Fix Critical Issues**: Address Test 4 first if it fails
5. **Re-test**: Verify fixes resolve the issues
6. **Document**: Update this report with actual findings

- Test file comments and inline documentation

## Conclusion

Agent 3 test suite is ready for execution once network access to `test.ankaa.live` is available. The most critical test (Test 4: File-Only Updates) will identify if there's a common form validation bug preventing users from uploading files without changing text fields.

All test artifacts, documentation, and quick reference guides have been created and are ready for use.

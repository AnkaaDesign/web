  "conclusion": "The test suite revealed critical issues with the cuts and airbrushings functionality. The primary blockers are: 1) Button selectors not matching actual implementation, 2) ES modules compatibility issue preventing file uploads, 3) Airbrushing rendering/detection issue. Once these are resolved, the test suite should provide comprehensive coverage of cuts and airbrushings functionality. The tests that did pass (4/16) suggest that navigation and basic form access is working correctly, so the issues are specific to cuts and airbrushings features rather than fundamental test infrastructure problems."

## Critical Issues

### üî¥ ISSUE-001: "Adicionar Recorte" Button Not Found (CRITICAL - P0)

**Description:** The button to add cuts is either not present, has incorrect selector, or is not clickable.

**Impact:**
- Cannot test core cut functionality
- Affects 5+ tests
- Blocks all cut-related testing

**Affected Tests:**
- Add single cut with required fields
- Add multiple cuts (up to 10)
- Test different cut types
- Remove a cut from form
- Preserve cuts when adding airbrushings

**Recommendation:**
- Inspect the actual task creation form DOM
- Verify button selector (text, class, id, role)
- Check if button is icon-only or has different text
- May need to use different element type (<a> vs <button>)

```typescript
// Current selector:
const addCutButton = page.locator('button').filter({ hasText: /adicionar recorte|add cut/i })

// May need to try:
// - By data-testid: page.locator('[data-testid="add-cut-button"]')
// - By icon: page.locator('button:has(svg.icon-scissors)')
// - By class: page.locator('.add-cut-button')
```

---

### üî¥ ISSUE-002: Airbrushings Not Rendering After Click (CRITICAL - P0)

**Description:** "Adicionar Aerografia" button is clicked successfully, but airbrushing accordion/form doesn't appear in DOM.

**Impact:**
- Cannot verify airbrushing creation in create form
- Affects 2 tests
- Suggests frontend rendering bug or incorrect selector

**Affected Tests:**
- Add single airbrushing with all fields
- Remove an airbrushing from form

**Recommendation:**
- Add screenshot immediately after button click
- Inspect DOM to see what elements are created
- Verify accordion selector is correct
- Check for loading states or delays

```typescript
// Current selector:
const airbrushingAccordion = page.locator('[role="region"]').filter({ hasText: /aerografia 1|airbrushing 1/i })

// May need to try:
// - Different role: page.locator('[data-accordion-item]')
// - Different text: filter({ hasText: /aerografia #1/i })
// - Wait for render: await page.waitForSelector('[role="region"]', { timeout: 5000 })
```

---

### üü† ISSUE-003: ES Modules __dirname Undefined (HIGH - P1)

**Description:** Test file uses `__dirname` which is not available in ES modules context.

**Impact:**
- Blocks file upload functionality
- Affects 6 tests
- Prevents testing of file-related features

**Affected Tests:**
- Add multiple cuts (up to 10)
- Test different cut types
- Add multiple airbrushings (up to 10)
- Test airbrushing with optional fields
- Handle file upload errors gracefully
- Update single cut in multiple cuts

**Recommendation:**
Replace __dirname with ES modules equivalent:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
import * as path from 'path';
const testFilesDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'test-files');

// AFTER:
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { dirname, join } from 'path';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);
const testFilesDir = join(__dirname, '..', 'test-files');
```

---

### üü† ISSUE-004: Task Form Elements Not Loading (HIGH - P1)

**Description:** Expected form elements like `input[name="name"]` not found within timeout period.

**Impact:**
- Cannot fill task basic fields
- Affects at least 1 test
- Suggests form structure may be different or slow to load

**Recommendation:**
- Verify correct URL: `/producao/cronograma/cadastrar`
- Check if form has loading skeleton/placeholder
- Increase wait time or add explicit wait
- Verify field names haven't changed

---

## Observations

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Authentication:** Login functionality works perfectly across all tests
2. **Navigation:** Can navigate to task list and edit forms successfully
3. **Edit Form Access:** All edit form tests can access existing tasks
4. **Airbrushings in Edit Mode:** Existing airbrushings are displayed correctly in edit forms

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Investigation

1. **Form Structure:** Task creation form may have different element structure than expected
2. **Button Selectors:** "Adicionar Recorte" button selector needs verification
3. **Rendering Delays:** Some elements may need explicit waits after interactions

### ‚ùå What's Not Working

1. **Cuts Button:** Cannot find or click the button to add cuts
2. **Airbrushings Rendering:** Airbrushings don't appear after clicking add button
3. **File Uploads:** Blocked by ES modules compatibility issue
4. **Form Field Access:** Some fields not accessible due to timeout/selector issues

## Conclusion

The test suite successfully identified critical issues with the cuts and airbrushings functionality:

1. **Button selectors are incorrect or buttons don't exist** - This is the primary blocker for cuts testing
2. **Airbrushings don't render after being added** - Critical issue suggesting a frontend bug
3. **File upload functionality is blocked** - ES modules compatibility issue (easy fix)
4. **Some form elements have unexpected selectors** - Form may have changed since test design

**The good news:**
- Navigation and authentication work perfectly
- Edit form access is reliable
- Airbrushings in edit mode are working

**The path forward:**
1. Fix the __dirname issue (10 minutes)
2. Inspect and document actual form selectors (30 minutes)
3. Re-run tests and verify improvements
4. Investigate airbrushing rendering if still failing

Once these issues are resolved, the test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:
- Adding single and multiple cuts/airbrushings
- Different cut types (VINYL/STENCIL)
- File uploads for cuts and airbrushings
- Editing existing cuts/airbrushings
- Removing cuts/airbrushings
- Optional field handling
- Coexistence of cuts and airbrushings

**Test Suite Quality:** The test suite itself is well-designed and comprehensive. The failures are due to implementation mismatches, not test design flaws. After fixing the selectors and ES modules issue, this suite will provide excellent coverage.
